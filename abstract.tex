The Data Management (DM) subsystem of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is responsible for creating the software, services, and systems that will be used to produce science-ready data products.
The software, currently under development, is heterogeneous, comprising both C++ and Python components, and is designed to facilitate both the processing of the observatory images and to enable value-added contributions from the broader scientific community.
Verification and validation of these software products, services, and systems is an essential yet time-consuming task.
In this paper, we present the tooling and procedures developed to ensure a systematic approach to the production of documentation for verification and validation.
By adopting a systematic approach, we guarantee full traceability to system requirements, integration with the projectâ€™s Systems Engineering model, and substantially reduce the time required for the whole process.
