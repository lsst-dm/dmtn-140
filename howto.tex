\title{How To Execute docsteady}
\mkshorttitle

\section{Introduction}

This is intended to be a short guide to help the installation and  execution of docsteady.


\section{Installation}

Create a conda environment based on docsteady:

\texttt{conda create --name docsteady-env docsteady -c gcomoretto}

Ensure that the conda configuration file  \texttt{.condarc} does not include the conda-forge channel.

To use docsteady, activate the environment as follows:

\texttt{conda activate docsteady-dev}

This environment will provide all dependencies that are required to build and run docsteady.

It is recommended to use the provided conda environment also for development activities.

Next release will make the distribution compatible with conda-forge. Future release should be provided in conda-forge channel instead of a private channel.


\section{Execution}

The information provided in this section is also available using the \texttt{--help} option.

In addition, existing documents have a \texttt{.docugen} file with the command to be executed in CI, that can be used as an example.

It is recommended to setup the following environment variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item JIRA\_USER
\item JIRA\_PASSWORD
\end{itemize}

otherwise it is required to specify them from command line.


\subsection{VCD genration}

\texttt{docsteady generate-vcd --sql True DM jira\_docugen.tex}

The command extracts from Jira all information regarding \textbf{DM} and generate the file \texttt{jira\_docugen.tex}.
This file is meant to be included in LDM-639.tex.

The VCD is generated accessing the database instead of using the REST API. Therefore the following environment variables should be specified:

\begin{itemize}
\item JIRA\_VCD\_USER
\item JIRA\_VCD\_PASSWORD
\end{itemize}

In addition, since the access to the Jira database is possible only from the Tucson network, it is required to be connected via VPN.


\subsection{Test Specification generation}


\subsection{Test Plan and Report generation}

\texttt{docsteady generate-tpr LVV-P72 DMTR-231.tex --trace true}

The command extract the information from Jira using REST API.
Each test plan and report has to correspond to a Jira test plan (i.e. LVV-P72).
The information is stored in a tex file, i.e. \texttt{DMTR-231.text}, that can be build directly.
An appendix file is also created, in this case \texttt{DMTR-231.appenx.tex}.

However additional files is required.

\begin{itemize}
\item Makefile
\item appendix.tex
\item history\_and\_info.tex
\end{itemize}

It should be possible to have the repository setup by sqrbot-jr (not available yet).
